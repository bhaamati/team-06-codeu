      <p>
        Women looking for information about and resources for reproductive health <br>
        Everyday women don’t always have great access to information about such things as 
        birth control, abortion, cervical health, etc. They click through the internet in an 
        endless stream of misinformation. <br>
        Their needs: Women need to have basic education about reproductive health and also have 
        access to resources that tell them where they should go in case they need reproductive 
        health care. They also need platforms on which to ask questions and communicate 
        concerns about their health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Women’s Rights Advocates <br>
        Who they are: Activists in the women’s reproductive health movement are women 
        and men engaged with the issue of making birth control, abortion, and overal women’s 
        reproductive health care legal, safe, available, and affordable. <br>
        Their needs: Activists often communicate and mobilize online. Online forums are useful 
        in organizing events, rallies, and on a basic level showing support. This user group needs 
        dedicated platforms on which to gain and also to disseminate information. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Politicians/Public Policy Makers
        Who they are: That rare breed of politician who might want look at facts and statistics 
        in order to educate himself or herself. <br>
        Their needs: Public policy makers are often woefully disconnected from what their 
        constituents needs especially when it comes to women’s reproductive health. They might 
        find easily digestible visual information in the form of graphics and charts helpful in 
        staying informed.
